# Computer Vision Fundamentals
Kyeongsoo Kim, March 2017 ~ September 2017

## 1. Introduction
It's an academic project for getting familar with a variety of aspects of Computer Vision field. With OpenCV library, I was focused on strengthening my abilities to use OpenCV for the most basic and important part of Computer Vision technology within graduate school level topic.

Since this project includes many files, I saparated all the files into 7 different sections.

## Part1.
Part1 consists of diverse topic for improving qualities of images. Topics included: historgram analysis(Stretching and Equalization), filtering(Gaussian mask, unsharp mask, median filter, bilateral filter.)

## Part2 and part3
Part2 and 3 consists of how to extract the diverse characteristics of images. Topics included: Geometric transformations, Edge extraction, Line extraction, circle extraction, corner extraction and texture extraction using Gabor filter or LBP histogram.

## Part4.
Part4 consists of labeling and division of the videos. Specifically, I did research about binarization, Morphology arithmetic operation, thinning algorithm, labeling algorithm and contour tracing. I also implemented simply shape detection and business card detection program in this part. 

## Part5
In part5, I built simple Augmented Reality using ARToolKit library and I studied following concepts: Flood fill, inpaint, distance transformation, Watershed algorithm,template matching, geometric moment, angle normalization using moment and invariant moments.

## Part6
Part6 consists of object extraction. Topics included: SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform) detection, type matching (using DMatch class), K-d tree, homography, RANSAC(RANdom SAmple Consensus), SURF(Speed-Up Robust Feature), Hamming distance, AKAZE(Accelerated KAZE matching), ORB matching, Images Stitching, and Viola-Jones face extraction algorithm.

## Part7.
Part7 consists of object extraction and machine learning. Topics included : Tracking Algorithms(Mean-shift, CamShift, Optical flow), HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and MSER algorithm, N&M, NN, kNN algorithms and SVM(Support Vector Machine). From understanding of those topics, I implemented several different handwritten numbers recognition program using those algorithms.
